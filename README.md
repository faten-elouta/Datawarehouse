# Datawarehouse
This repository contains several datasets and a powerpoint file desribing the datasets: Covid19Canada, Covid19France and policier-shooting. The objective is to build a data warehouse for showcasing the Assess OLAP intentional operator. We proposed a conceptual model using DFM notation for each of the dataset.
